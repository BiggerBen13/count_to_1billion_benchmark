# What this is

I threw this example together because [this short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/elehXpAvAUo) made me really angry.
I have now expanded this as general benchmarking framework to compare how different languages loop to 1,000,000,000.
Yes, I am aware of how stupid simple language comparisons like this are.

For instructions on adding your own language please look at [adding your own lanugage](./ADDING_LANGUAGES.md)

## Running
To run all optimized language benchmarks simply do `make run`

To run just one of the languages do `make run_<language>` or `make run_<language>_noopt` incase there's an unoptimized version.

## Benchmarking

see [table](./timings.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Run on a m1pro macbook with 16GB of ram
